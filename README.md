# Numerical Method CSE 218

CSE 218 is divided into two parts
- CSE 218T Thoery
  - CSE 218S Sessional
    In this repo I will compile all the codes needed for this course. 
    Pyhton is the mandatory langugage for this. Although at past Matlab was used.
    But due to some issues we are using python with libraries like Numpy, pandas (Fun fact: A group of pandas is called an embarrassment. I am a group of pandas :panda_face: )
